They are intended to be disposable but I was able to dishwasher some without issue just don 't use the heated dry feature or they melt . || review: First tried these at a bar and then got them for a person party ! Kinda pricey but worth it for entertainment ! Super fun and you can 't even taste the shots go down if you use it right !

I moved from a Remington rotary shaver , and this is far superior both in comfort and smooth results.Highly recommend . || review: I have use this daily since mid-2001 .

The only problem I have with this product is that the replacement foils ( approx . $ 30 ) and cleaner refills are expensive--I 've found that I get only a couple of \" cleanings \" out of each refill . || review: The shaver is good , but I had to get rid of that awful automatic cleaner / lubricator ; it was full of isopropyl alcohol and it made the bathroom smell like a hospital . Plus , it got stuck & wouldn 't open to replace the little tanks of alcohol-cleaner . The whole cleaning apparatus broke apart & made a mess . || review: This Braun shaver is a replacement for another model . I like the cleaning feature , which allows the consumer to pick which or all function ( s ) the cleaning unit allows .

The batteries I got had an experation date of 2005 . Buyer beware . || review: These batteries got here in a timely manner , and seem to be doing what it 's supposed to be doing . Haven 't had any problems since I changed the batteries . || review: I have only used one at this time and it 's working . Reason for 4 star is there is no expiration date on the package .

I ordered a large ( size 12 shoes ) and it was too loose to provide any sort of support . A sizing chart would help . Otherwise the sleeve is well made . || review: This is comfortable and offers good , but not great , support . I find the one-size-fits-all adjustable ankle supports to be too bulky and uncomfortable . Size small is good for an average woman 's ankle . || review: Gives me that extra support after I twisted my ankle . Gets uncomfortable to work out in though . I do moderate to intense exercising and gets a little pressure tension under my foot arch . Other than that , walking and working with it on really helps . I am about a size 6-6 / 12 and took the small . Fits perfect even with socks on .\n\n The summary of the reviews is:"}

Do not rinse your mouth after each use , that way it will keep working . Has a pleasant sweet taste . || review: Oral health : this is especially for people on multiple meds , including prednisone , to prevent dental problems . Would recommend daily use , as directed , to improve and maintain oral health . Make your dentist 's day - show him you care enough to make dental hygiene as part of your daily regimen .\n\n The summary of the reviews is:"}

One on , however , it does offer a softer grip . || review: I bought the Heavenly Handle when I purchased the HurryCane and it helped me immensely .

I wanted night lights with the air freshener built in to periodically put throughout the house , and these fit the bill perfectly . || review: This night light is very bright . If the oil fragrance you are using is clear in color , it will light up the whole room . I am currently using a red colored scent so it tones down the brightness a bit .

Maybe it was just this particular supplier because i never got one that didn 't work when I 've picked one up in the stores . I would not recommend . || review: I wish I would have listened to the other reviews and not purchased . Half of them never lost their oil and even those that did , you couldn 't smell . || review: I couldn 't find these in the store any more and found this great deal . I use it in the bathroom so we don 't have to turn on the overhead light at night . They do stop working after a while , ( mine have gone at least 1-2 years ) , but they are inexpensive and disposable . || review: I bought one of these maybe a month ago ? I put it in my half-bath and have liked it The oil has run out which I 'm not concerned about . But the light has stopped working already ! Does there have to be oil in the warmer for the light to work ? I can 't find the answer to this anywhere . || review: Works well as a combo night light with day light sensor , so it turns off and on automatically . Works well in the areas I needed it .\n\n The summary of the reviews is:"}

Nice thick leather . Very solid and strong clip . The lighter has a very snug fit and will make a custom fit after a few day .

I have a couple $ 150 brushes and they lose hair all the time , so I decided to buy a cheaper badger brush and glad I Did ! Give it a try ! || review: it was very smooth sailing for a time and then the bristles began to fall out amking it cumbersome to shave. too bad because the bristles were very soft and smooth. can 't recommend this one . || review: I have been using shaving brushes purchased in the drugstore for several years and have not really been satisfied with their quality or the lather they produced . This brush is of a much higher quality and its bristles do a much better job of producing lather and working it into my beard than the brushes previously used . || review: This is a must for anyone trying shaving cream . It really makes a difference . The hairs are soft and yet don 't absorb too much water . I definitely recommend it . || review: I have had this for about two months and haven 't had any issues. easy to use and clean holds shape well .\n\n The summary of the reviews is:"}

Some users suggest buying the longer, narrower Bona head with velcro strips for more aggressive cleaning and cost-saving as it can grip any microfiber towel.
