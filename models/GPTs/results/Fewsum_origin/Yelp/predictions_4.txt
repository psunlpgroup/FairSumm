Can 't believe what they put in there ! ! || review: Cheap and easy lunch . Slow service . Food was mediocre . Got quite busy at lunch . Great patio , was perfect for people watching along the busy street . Asked for gluten free options but the waitstaff was unsure about what that meant . || review: The food here is alright . Cheaper than many places , but quality is not always the best . The vermicelli is a little bland , the grilled pork with rice tasted wonderful , and the pho could have been better as the broth was a little bland as well . || review: arrived very quickly. great pad thai. other dish ( # 65 ) was very fresh , fresh veg and fresh shrimp but a little lacking in flavour , thats why the rating is 4 not 5. will def order again ! || review: Hearty portions , inexpensive and with a pleasant outdoor terrace . We like the soups and the fried dishes for a quick meal in our neighbourhood . || review: I 've been hard-pressed to find good Chinese food since I left Vancouver , but DAMN this shit was good .

I tried the new hand rolled sushi ... They must have a 4 year old rolling it . Smallest roll I 've ever seen in my life . || review: If you ask me ? I thought this was awful and the cashier was a unfriendly . The caramel chicken was ok but the brown rice did not taste done to me .. overall it 's a nice comfortable setting . || review: This is a great place for a quick , healthy lunch .

Convenient location : Located on the skywalk which leads upto the mall.a 10 min walk ( in the snow ) to the nearest CTrain station.Tip : Skywalk sorta closed in the weekends ( which sucked ) Price : we were there off season ( March ) and got a decent deal on Priceline . || review: We had an amazing time , the staff were very nice and accomodating , very clean and beautiful room . So nice that they had a restau bar in the lobby area Highly recommended . || review: Great hotel ! New and clean layout , friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere . No problems at all ! The one downside : You have to pay for parking ( because it 's downtown ) but that 's to be expected for the main Calgary area . || review: Clean place , most of the staff members are nice . But some were very difficult and were not accommodating . We had a room paid for , for 4 days and we just wanted to change the reservation name and they did not accommodate and made it very difficult for us . I probably wouldn 't stay here again . || review: Never get the deluxe room . It was exactly same as standard room just up a few floors . No seating area , no dresser , few drawers , poor communication skills regarding hotel amenities . No bottled water offered in room . ETC . Not anywhere near deluxe ! ! !

It has a much better selection of food and organics than other frys , though their pita breads could have more of a selection than the off brand ones . I throughly like this store || review: I made a purchase here for gift cards during Christmas and they called a manager on duty on me . The manager treated me with extreme prejudice and made my whole transaction feel like I was buying illegal substances . You can expect a convenient store with probably everything you need but I would go straight to self check out because they have horrible customer service . || review: ClickList is my ish . $ 4.95 to be able to order my groceries from anywhere , shop for me & load my car . It 's a no brainer with an 18 month old & one on the way . || review: Frys ads are false advertising . They have advertised for 2 weeks that the have pumpkin cheerios , Starbucks Pumpkin Spice ground coffee & other pumpkin products . Don 't rush to their stores because they don 't have them . || review: So busy at the deli , I took a number like it said no one followed the numbers I was skipped several times . The ladies in the back were too concerned with making chicken instead of helping customers . All I wanted was some chicken , I left after 15 wasted minutes with nothing !
