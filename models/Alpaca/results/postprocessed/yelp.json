Waited 10 mins in front of the cash to place my order and none of the employees even acknowledge my friend and I waiting , so we left || i ordered the scrambled tofu sandwich southwest style which was not spicy enough for me. i love the wooden panel walls in the restaurant. the bun was rosemary herb which i thought was delicious . || I love the spicy sweet potato burger here .

Don 't go if in a hurry meant to be enjoyed . || Food is consistently good , but on the most recent evening out , we found the server too pushy .

This is a hidden gem in the city ! || I went there because of the scallops dish posted on Yelp . I was so disappointed in finding out that they took it off the menu .

Need to try the food next time I 'm in town . || This place is a hidden gem . Beautiful view . The food was very good -- had the fish tacos and scallops and thought both were excellent . My wife originally didn 't like her sangria ( truth , the white sangria is really bad ) but the waiter brought out an extra glass of wine for her to try instead --very good service . || Had to wait several minutes to be sat when the restaurant was mostly empty . Our waitress took over 10 minutes to take our order and that 's when we left . Menu was short but looked like it was good quality , although expensive for burgers / bar food .

I smell a raise . || Food was great as usual it 's what you come to expect from an In N Out .

Their Creme Brûlée unfortunately was already sold out . Oh well the perks of living close by || While I enjoyed my black sesame and matcha swirl soft serve , my husband 's anmitsu with just matcha ice cream was a little strong on the matcha flavour .

I would not be surprised if I 'm sick later .", "prediction": "The reviews of this restaurant are overall positive, with customers praising the friendly service and delicious noodles. Ask Ace to make you a \"Korean chirashi bowl\" which he adds a spicy Korean red chili sauce to, and you will not regret it!
