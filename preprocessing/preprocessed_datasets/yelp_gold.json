      "This property features a staff who is attentive and friendly.  The complimentary breakfast has a variety of delicious items.  The evening snacks are a great added bonus.  The housekeeping staff does a great job on the rooms and public areas.  The hotel looks brand new!  The pool is a great addition.  The only drawback is that the bed linens are on the thin side, but this can be remedied by bringing a blanket.  This is a great property!"

I'm sure there are rules about shooting reloads or steel core but I don't use that junk so I really couldn't tell you. || They have shuttle service to varies resorts to pick you up. The driver was very friendly and able to discuss guns at length. 'Little John' a range safety officer helped us and did the range work with us. We shot an AK-47 and the M-4. John was very knowledgeable, friendly and eager to help us have an awesome experience. || Went to Discount Firearms and they taught our group valuable gun safety and then we shot awesome machine guns.

Anyways I love the server named arcy I do recommend him to others as he is very nice:)))))) || IHOP is IHOP.... so the 2 star rating is not for the nation wide chain, it's for this specific location. This IHOP has really really bad service, food takes a long time to show up, drink refiles never come, and it's not as clean as I would like. || Horrible service we put our name in never got called was skipped and host said he called our name when he never once called our name.... Will not be coming back after 30 min wait and he is telling everyone 10-15 min wait.... As he had already crossed off our name...... Service was horribleDoes Not Deserve 1 Star only gave cause I had to... || On September 13, 2014 we went to this IHOP again. We were seated and given menus but after that we were completely ignored. The server never did come back to take our order and after about 15 minutes of waiting we got up and left the restaurant, unable to even order our food.Extremely poor service. || I didn't give one star because this if the first time this has happened. We got some pancakes to go / pickup. The cook must have been multitasking a bit too much. Our stack of pancakes were burnt. Not happy when we got home and opened the container...."

      "The food in this restaurant is generally well-received, though tastes vary. The service and waitstaff are friendly and efficient. The main issue is that the decor and atmosphere is very dated. The restaurant is recommended for those who prefer classic American restaurant staples and don't mind (or prefer) a more old-fashioned atmosphere.",
      "A restaurant that offers some good dishes especially the salads, served by friendly and courteous staff. However, the environment is a bit old-fashioned, and some dishes fall below expectation. Overall moderately-recommended place",
      "The best part about this gem is the waitstaff. They were friendly, on top of things and very knowledgeable of the menu. The French onion soup and Irish spring roll are the stars of the menu. Even with the outdated atmosphere, it’s a great experience with reasonably priced food."

        "We've been here several times before, and it's always been okay-maybe a little less. We went today, and it was really good. The entire restaurant was cleaner, and the food was very tasty, much better than before. I'd definitely recommend it. || This is my favorite mexican restaurant the food is more on the traditional mexican style. They are the perfect combination of flavors and textures, cheap and excellent food. I'm extremely picky about Mexican food and this place is the only one I've ever been for real Mexican food. || I have been living in NC for 8 years and this is the best Mexican food I've had since moving here. Food was great. Had a shrimp dish and everything was cooked to perfection. My wife had a Burrito and that was really good also. This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. || I have frequently visited this place for dinner over the last 10 years. The quality of food has been great every time. Only concern, it use to be very cheap to eat here however prices have increased over the years to where it's no longer a bargain. Food is still worth the price. || Delicious, affordable and a little nicer than most Mexican restaurants I've been to, but it's still pretty casual. I really like their seafood burrito. It's yummy! It's easy to find (right on the side of Roosevelt) and they have great dips. || This is our first time to eat at this location. We have eaten at the Waxhaw location three separate occasions. The food has been consistently good. We thought we would have to give up good Mexican food when we left Texas. We have been pleasantly surprised. Mucho gusto. || This is without a doubt my favorite mexican resturant in town. The dip is fantastic, the employees are wonderful and you can be in and out in 15 minutes. Everything on the menue is good and it is priced well. Easy 5 Star. || Stopped here for a quick supper and had the carne asado tacos and one grilled chicken taco. The carne tacos were super. Chicken was bland. Beautiful presentation on authentic colorful plates. Bill was $14 and I gave waiter a $20 and he asked if I wanted change. Ummmm yeah so I just paid $20 for three tacos.",

I would recommend for patio drinks but do dinner somewhere else. || First time eating here ordered the poutine burger and I was a but skeptial at first but I'm glad I went with my gut feeling because it was amazing a bit sloppy so wouldn't recommend for a first date lol but other then that it was fantastic I'll definetly be returning! || Had the chicken wings. I could have made better at home. Other than the crappy food, the waiter was giving us some attitude and they put us right next to smokers on the patio. Shame because it is a nice patio. || Decent-ish food but bad service. We asked for fish and chips and upon inquiring after 50 min turns out the kitchen never received the order. In turn, they were hardly apologetic. Not going there again, despite the fact their patio is nice. They can really make good business out of it, but they are not interested. || Came here 2 days in a row on a Sunday and Monday. I was staying down the street at the Hyatt. Bathrooms have a pissy smell. Food is good, though. Not many patrons. I'm curious when there busy time is. || This is a nice place! Clean and respectable, I went with a friend and my teen son. The food was good very tasty. I was disappointed at the rib. They were good but too small and they looked prepackaged. The waitress was really friendly and attentive. Lots of T.V's was a good thing as we went for super bowl.",
        "",
        "Food was okay. Poor service, downright rude waitresses even though the restaurant wasn't full. Wasn't even given forks / knives with the food, and took up to 15 minutes to flag the waitress down who seemed to ignore it at first. Won't be returning to this place. Save your money and go elsewhere."

Either way we enjoyed our movie and the staffs are friendly and theater was very clean and well taken care of. No trash on the floor and everything was just great. || Like I mentioned before.... Very clean well kept place. Went back and they made my salt free popcorn with a smile and no hair! Managers contacted me and made sure to ask employees to pull hair back. Definitely the cleanest theater in town. || Love this theatre it's ALWAYS clean and is never packed. Unlike Harkins Gateway on 99th Ave and McDowell which always is over crowded with people. Great places to shop and eat after or before a movie. I would recommend this theatre to anybody. || Happy to be a Harkins customer. Prices for concessions are steep but that is somewhat expected. I like that they give you a free popcorn if you buy a $25 gift card. Use the gift card to pay for tickets and other goodies. Upgrade to a large popcorn and save the bag for next time. Nice way to get more for your dollar. || I love this movie. Clean. Friendly. Management is always on their employees about customer service. They are a bit pricey but worth it. I always go an hour early because the theatre gets busy quick. Love the shopping and food around it. Always clean and on time. Awesome experience || Love it here there's always plenty of room Harkins Theatres and lots of things to do in this little shopping plaza, there's lots of good food a lots of good shopping around here all the family and kids living around here it's nice || Harkins is an amazing company. They offer the best perks! But this location has Jozie, GODDAMNIT.... This woman is smoking hot with that amazing red hair.Even with the old style seats i'm coming here just to catch a glimpse.",

There have been complaints of customers being either cut or not happy with the appearance of their pedicure or manicure. Sometimes they close earlier than their scheduled working hours.",

      "The nail technician and manager are very friendly and the salon looks good, but some of the nail technicians have a tendency to make mistakes and the salon doesn't admit to them. The nail salon tends to close early. While the official closing time may be 6 pm or 8 pm, that isn't the case."

      "The overall feel of the store was very pleasant. The employees were very nice, friendly and help with everything. Always have a very good selection of beers and other alcohol.

        "Very nice staff! It's always packed in here & I'm not surprised! Quality food! Lots of options! I absolutely love the vegan options as well as the GMO-free foods (all Trader Joe's brand is GMO-free). I have to say the prices are greats as well! Love TJ's!! || I love getting my Pirate Booty from here (the puffs people) and the ready made pizzas, pretty much everything that they have ready made is really good. The store can get pretty crowded, especially during the dinner hour rush. Employees are friendly and I recommend you take advantage of the samples throughout the store. Come hungry! || This store gives me a nice and warm feeling. The feeling that I didn't and won't have with Walmart Market. Trader Joe's has a lot of eye-catching snacks and healthy food. Therefore, I have no idea which items I should buy. If I can, I want to try everything. Absolutely, comeback || Checked out this location.

It is a great quiet spot for anyone to enjoy when a sushi craving strikes.",

        "Great lunch place, with reasonable prices. The Sushi Rock combo is good and will fill you up (soup, salad, nigiri and a spicy salmon roll for around $15.) It's on the same block as Absolute Comedy, which makes it a great place to take a date for a pre-show dinner. || Good food. Great service good price. I and my family been here one a month. For 2 years clean. Quiet. Cozy But not too much food if you like quiet and cozy this place good for you. Come to try || All the sushi we ordered tasted great. According to my Japanese friend with me, he said that the quality of the sushi was pretty good. The service was decent and the servers were as friendly as they had to be. Overall great experience for a guy who does not have sushi too often. || My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by the great quality of sushi from Sushi Rock. The standout items for me were the Four Seasons roll, barbecue eel and the Crunch roll. I'm giving a 4 star because there is room for improvement but regardless, it's definitely my new favorite neighborhood sushi place!! || Sushi is fantastic for the price, which is very reasonable for the neighbourhood, service is great, portions are large and the selection is fantastic! They are great with kids and very flexible about menu substitutions. Try some specials instead of the all-you-can-eat, I recommend the torched sushi! || Subpar sushi, but good serving sizes for the price we paid. Took a while for service to come to us, even after asking several times. Ordered a Coke, and it didn't come until we asked again. But it's sushi, and sushi is good. || I like this restaurant and I'm regular comustomer.Every time I go there I gave the tip over the% 15 but i won't give them a tip anymore.I knew that the servers can't get the tip.Their wage is just $12- $14 / hour including a tip.It was shocked.You don't need to give the tip for servers.",
        "",
        "Not the greatest sushi option around this area. The restaurant looked dated, and the food was not the best. I ended up feeling a little sick after eating here. I mostly ate sashimi, so maybe the fish was not in its best condition, or was not fresh enough."

        "This location has pretty much gone down hill through the years in terms of service. The baristas seem like they don't want to be there and who ever is stationed at the register in the morning acts like its a burden that you're ordering coffee so early. Weird. || I come here everyday. The baristas are all very friendly and always recognize us when we walk in. The manager John is very nice. They always have our mobile orders ready when we walk in. Never had an issue here. Will continue to come back! || Great place to stop by first thing in the morning. There's an Asian chick that works there who's the bomb! It's nice to have someone recognize you and start making your drink as soon as you walk through the front door! Definitely one of my favorite spots. || Terrible service! I came in to get iced coffee.. Sat outside and came back for my refill and they said 'no.. Can't do it if you leave the store!' Wow... I love Starbucks and never had an issue like this before. Not ever coming back to this location ever!!!! || Worst cappuccino ever. Burnt flavor and they made it twice. Way to throw $4 down the toilet. If they can't train people to do it right then don't waste your time. McDonald's coffee is better then this.",
        "I just went thru the drive thru, and the coffee was extremely cold. The guy at the window didn't seem to be coherent! I am paying $7 for a cold cup of coffee?? This isn't the first time my coffee is cold.",
        "Coffee is usually good, today they had to finish brewing the decaf. I waited and what did I end up with, a cup full of coffee grounds. Had to spit out most of the cup of coffee.Guess I need to bring my own filter when I visit this Starbucks. Very disappointed. || Excellent coffee and seating areas. I like it when seating areas take up more space than stupid retail. Who's thinking of buying an espresso machine early in the morning. Let me drink my coffee and hop on the wifi. I'm here every week so, no complaints and my order is always exactly how I like it."

The only thing I would have liked to seen more of is the chicken that goes in the 'make it yourself bowl'. Next time I'll just order extra chicken to it. Other than that I will be definitely coming back! || Discovered this extraordinary sushi gem while on a business trip to Phoeni. Albeit hidden near Nordstrom s Rack yet well worth the hint. Friendly staff. High quality sushi. Reasonable serving sizes. Highly recommend. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy. || Food-born illness? Gee, thanks so much. Just want I wanted. As if hearing the chef (and also possibly manager?) talk down to his employees right in front of customers repeatedly wasn't enough to make me uncomfortable as a patron, imagine how I'm feeling hunched over my toilet here at 5: 00 am right now. || The poke bowls are great! I get the grilled shrimp over mixed greens with mango, edamame and avocado. Hawaiian dressing. Garnished with sushi ginger, red pepper flakes and green onions. Easy to get to, solid service, great iced tea. It's a lunchtime staple || Ate here tonight at 7 and the girl making sushi was great with helping me out. There was a mix up with the rolls ordered and she corrected my roll right away and got my roomie his correct roll also. She knows amazing customer service! Sad I didn't get her name.",

      "This butcher shop manages to mesh modern and old-fashioned meat market characteristics very well. While it can be a bit pricey, the quality of the meat is well worth it, and the knowledge and friendliness of the staff is above average.  The piri piri chicken isn't great, but there are so many selections that are excellent. This shop is highly recommended.",
      "Sanagan's defines an old-fashioned butcher. The staff is extremely knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. and a number system is implemented, which makes the service very organized. The selection is extensive, but it is also expensive. That being said, the quality is worth the price. The establishment also offers some prepared foods, but there are only a few tables available for patrons wishing to dine in rather than take orders home.",
      "Sanagan's butcher shop is one of the best around. Their customer service is top-notch. The staff is very knowledgeable, friendly, and enthusiastic about giving advice. The products are also very good quality, including the prepared meats. This is a very highly recommended butcher shop."

        "So many delicious options. We got wagyu beef and it was expensive AF but honestly amazingly good. A good alternative to St Lawrence Market (because of SLM shit hours). I would go back and try more options, I like their take a number system. || I picked up a frozen tourtiere for Christmas eve. It was easy to bake and absolutely delicious. The staff were incredibly helpful and I'm really looking forward to checking out some of their other offerings, including other pies and cassoulet.

Stepped into Sanagan's on a whim and picked up the some of the biggest, juiciest and appropriately spiced pork sausages. Fair price point and great customer service--these guys know their meat. || I feel like I am going back in time when I walk into Sanagan's. The strangely familiar smell, the sawdust on the floor and actual animals in the display cases are rarely seen anymore in today's plastic wrapped meat-counters.

The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and there are always a few people working so I never have to wait in line. I love stopping in here to peruse and always leave with something great. || The best butcher's place I've ever stepped into. This place has everything you need. Fresh, delicious, mostly organic!

        "That rating is based solely on the phone service when I called to place a delivery order just now. Rude could be a little on the strong sode, but is not an entirely inaccurate description. I will post more when we get our food I. 45 - 50 minutes. || The Tom kha is pretty good, panang curry was okay too but they are stingy on the meat and their tempura is more like fishstick breading, definitely not tempura. It was okay. Probably find a different place to eat next time. || Ordered tom kha today and opt for delivery. The soup came sooner than they had quoted which was nice, and the soup itself was delicious and the portion is enough to last a few days! The man who delivered it was also very kind. Will absolutely be ordering again! Thank you papaya Thai! || Ordered deliver thru Eat24 tonight. Mixed app - most items over cooked. The brownish dipping sauce had an off flavor. No idea what it was. Pad Woon Sen - Bland and no heat. Overall a let down. I had hoped I'd have the same experience as many of the others that had given good reviews on the delivery. Oh well. || Awesome place! Called in and told them we would be heading over and we were running late and they held the restaurant open for us until we got there. Truly nice people and great management. I seriously recommend you go. Love their appetizers! || Chicken was undercooked. The curry was pretty good, very large serving.The place looks run down and it looks like the workers live there, looked dirty, worn and really old.I doubt we'd ever dine in and with the to go order under cooked we will not be ordering from Papaya again. || Ordered via Grubhub while at a sand volleyball tournament. The food was great! Who knew pumpkin could make a great curry! Then i read the reviews on here and was like uh oh. Never the less, this experience the food was great. I took off a star just because they took longer than expected.",

Just go there an eat, you won't be sorry. || I don't even live in Pittsburgh but anytime we are on a road-trip and Pittsburgh is along Route... we take a two hour detour just for Salem's Grill! The chicken burger is best I've ever had. The meat curry and and their spinach is another must try! We wish they had market like this in every state!",

        "Really disappointed. Just order chicken tikka for lunch via postmates. The chicken was dry, minimal sauce (which was probably the most flavorless tikka masala I've ever had) and the salad had zero dressing on it. Will give them another shot but really disappointed."

      "This Indian restaurant is very well-regarded. The food is great; the Chicken Tikka Masala in particular is very well-liked. The atmosphere is also excellent, with friendly, efficient customer service and a newly-renovated interior. The only caveat is that the price is a little high.
