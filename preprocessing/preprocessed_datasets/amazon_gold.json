        "The bag is A LOT smaller than it appears, i though i could fit my school books in it but i definitely cannot. However it's a really cute bag and i will still get a lot of use out of it.",
        "I chose it because it's a beautiful purse, but too many straps (4) they come off, but then the connecter is still visible. I had to return it, I couldn't even see a way to have my leather person doctor it up without ruining the beauty of it. || I like the purse, but you definitely can't carry it often because the stones fall off a lot. Its a decent size snd the material is a decent quality. I would love the purse if the stones didn't fall off. || i bought this purse and was worried it wouldnt come as it said in the ad. when it arrived at my home i was more than extatic when i saw how nice it was. i am actually very impressed by this purse, and reccomend it to any one looking to spice up there out fit. looks great with boots and leggings!",
        "Love this! pretty size: not to big? not to small, color and shape! and very flashy. Everyone loves it! all the stones were on it when it arrived at my house and only one fell off as i was trying it out!"

It may even allow for multiple Halloween uses. The fabric is a little thin but overall, perfect quality for a Halloween costume. Kids absolutely love it!",
      "This Thomas the Tank costume is perfect for small children. It fits most children up to five or six years old, and could even be used multiple times as the child grows. It has a handy pouch on the front that holds a large load of candy. The costume is highly recommended."

My cruise happened to meet some heavy showers and I felt no dizziness or sickness except the constant waving feeling:) Definitely will bring it along next time I go to cruise again or plan to ride roller coasters. || This is my favorite type of motion sick medicine. It doesn't make me drowsy and it works well. The chewable tablets don't taste too bad and I'd rather chew a tablet than swallow one whole anyway. Great product! || I've been taking this medicine since I was a little one and it works great! I get motion sickness so easily, but if I take one Bonine, I don't get sick! I can travel for hours in the car, ride all the looping, twisting, crazy rides at the amusement parks and not get sick! It's wonderful. || I stopped riding on roller coasters and other rides at most amusement parks until I started taking the BONINE tablets. Works well for me and I take it in the morning about an hour before going on any ride and I have been able to enjoy the rides with my kids!! No more nausea and headache!!! || Product worked the very way it was intended. We were on a cruise that had high seas and because we were unable to use the patches that go behind the ear, we used this as an alternative. It worked great, no problems. || Husband and I went on week long live-aboard scuba trip. I could not have had a good time without these. THANK GOD.. it was a wonderful trip, and I did not get sea-sick at all, in a full week never leaving the small yacht we dove from. Recommend!",

      "This is a very effective option for dealing with motion sickness. It can be used for car rides, amusement parks and even multi-day cruises, all without the side effects seen with Dramamine. This is an easy to take pill which won't cause drowsiness often works with one dose. It is a highly recommended product for prevention of motion sickness.",
      "This medication is a true lifesaver when it comes to motion sickness. The tablets are easy to take and easy to travel with and it seems to cause less drowsiness when compared to other medications of this type. It is good to always have this on hand just in case when traveling."

      "This is a great ice maker that works quickly, is easy to use, and can be used in a variety of situations (camping, poolside, parties, etc). It is durable and reliable, even in extreme temperatures. Though it is different from a regular ice machine, it can be used to have ice 24/7.",
      "Awesome ice maker that is easy to use, makes ice quickly, and is much more reliable than most ice makers built into refrigerators. Works well for parties and entertaining, RV traveling, as well as to save money not needing to buy ice from the store. It will eventually pay for itself!",
      "This ice maker performs very well and consistently produces nice, large cubes of ice. It is well built and lasts for many years of use without issue even in extreme temperatures. Useful for parties, entertaining and camping, it's simple to operate, fast and efficient but does need to be manually emptied and cleaned."

        "It worked as advertised although I didn't check to see if it make the actual 27 pounds per day. I bought it for the camper and seemed to satisfy the demand for ice. It sure beats paying $3 / bag at the camp store. It won't take long to pay for it.",
        "Very different from what I'm used to which is a regular freezer ice maker. It's kind of a process if you use all the time, which I do, you develop a system. Makes ice fast. Simple to operate. || Gave this as a gift to my daughter and son-in-law for their deck. The have numerous pool parties and according to my daughter, this works great. It prevents wet feet from going in the house to get ice. It fits nicely on their deck and they seem to be enjoying it. || I thought this was exactly like my current ice maker but when it got here it wasn't. Once seeing it I wondered what size it was going to make but was pleasantly surprised at the size of the large cubes. It ended up being all it was advertised to be and I love it. I would recommend it to all. || This thing works like a charm. We use it in our bar at home and in our RV when traveling. You just have to remember to empty it when not in use and keep it clean. It does the job for parties! Very fast and efficient. || absolutely love it!!! this is the 2nd one we have. The 1st one lasted 8 years!!! I love having ice made all the time. I have it made by the refrigerator also but I love this machine better. || So far I love this device. It cranks out ice in minutes. Perfect to have for entertaining, We actually bought this as a back up for our unreliable built in ice maker in our fridge. This has saved the day. || We have had this machine for 2 years. It sits outside on our patio in Arizona. It hits 115 degrees in the summer. It has been cleaned one a month and has NEVER stopped or had any kind of problems. We just keep filling it with water and it keeps making ice 24 / 7 / 365."

MAKES EXCELLENT STEAMED SHRIMP, THE RICE IS PERFECT EVERY TIME, VEGETABLES TASTE GREAT. JUST A USEFUL ITEM TO HAVE IN THE KITCHEN. || I love this steamer. I use it to steam all kinds of vegetables and new potatoes. I really like the larger basket and the screen where you can put herbs or spices to flavor what you are cooking. I highly recommend it. || Sometimes I use the steamer for just one vegetable, or for rice, but it's really nice to have the separate basket when I want to steam two separate vegetables at the same time. I've been very pleased with the steamer and have used it several times already. The instruction book in helpful too. Thank you. || This is our second B / D steamer. The first served us well for years before the plexiglass bowl cracked and finally broke. It was impossible to find a replacement in any major chain stores. Lots of rice steamers but no small in size vegetable steamers. Amazon came through again. Thanks Jeff!"

      "This FM/AM radio, iPhone docking station and alarm clock is a perfect combination! The sound is amazing, the alarm clock is not annoying, and the design looks great! It would be nice to have a place to use an aux cord and certain apple products require a $5 adapter to use the docking station but other than that, this product is fantastic!",
      "The Sony product is great and the radio have high quality speaker. It is also packed with the capacity to charge other gadgets. The remote control can also work with phones which makes it comfortable and a great buy. Though it can sometimes be difficult to get and switch stations with some constant static.",
      "This Sony radio is very high quality. The sound is very clear and crisp, almost as if it's live. The charging station is very useful for charging an iPhone or iPod, but an adapter is required for a Nano. The preset stations, clock, and alarm are useful additional features that help make it a great product."

But in any way it's easy to use and works well for us. || I love these cleaners. They are easy to use and do a great job. Some people have commented they wish they had more cleaning agent, but I think they have more than enough and often use one to clean two toilets. || I love these - most practical bathroom item created - but what is going on??? Chlorox customer service advised they have discontinued! What a huge disappointment after throwing away the old brushes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! || These are great because they are sanitary (unlike the scrubbers that get reused everytime). I use these for one cleaning, then throw away (without having to touch anything!) Good scrubbing action, and gets the toilet good and clean. || These are great buys. They are smaller than the regular size but well big enough to clean the toilet, much more efficient, I always felt wasting when use the regular ones and now with these, work great and well worth the money. || I have been using these for a long time, what I like about them is they are disposable and you do not have to look at a stained toilet bowl brush in the corner. Clorox toilet bowl cleaners do a very nice job. || i live in a condo and only have 1 toilet that doesn't have to be cleaned every week. so this is perfect. no clutter next to the toilet with unsightly brushes and throwing the tip away after each makes cleaning the bathroom much more palatable. || Who wants to stick their hand in a toilet? Not I! I love the wand and the refills are wonderful. NO touching required, and they scrub very well! My toilet bowl is gleaming after using these!! I'll never use anything else."

      "This butane conversion allows for the case of a classic Zippo to clean burning butane lighter.  It allows for flame height adjustments and holds its flame well.  It is a durable and reliable product that holds up well to wear and use. While this is not a licensed Zippo product it is important to note that its fit is not guaranteed.",
      "This butane powered Zippo lighter boasts an electric ignition functions better than Zippo's traditional flint wheel. The size of the flame is easily adjustable with the turn of a screw, so excess butane is not wasted based on the consumers preference. The only drawback is that it may not fit some lighter cases.",
      "This lighter insert fits inside a traditional Zippo case but doesn't use lighter fluid. It lasts longer than a traditional insert and costs less. It looks like a Zippo but works better and uses butane. The ignition is electric, not flint, and the flame can withstand wind without being blown out. Overall this lighter insert is recommended."

I been using it for months now--and not one burp!:) || If you are like me I like sushi but I couldnt stand the constant taste of it when I was taking regular fish oil and krill oil pills, this is why I stopped taking them. the directions said to drink a lot of water when taking them and I did but it didnt matter. I love this fish oil it does what it says.. || For anyone like myself who uses Omega 3 Fish oil on a regular basis, I recommend this product. This is the burp-less version which leaves no after taste in your mouth and is easily swallowed with a small amount of liquid. Stay heart healthy and take Omega 3 daily."
